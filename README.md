Penalized Trust Region algorithm for minimum time-of-flight 6DOF powered descent guidance. Algorithm is based on the following paper
[Successive Convexification for 6-DoF Mars Rocket Powered Landing with Free-Final-Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03827.pdf) by Miki
Szmuk and Behçet Açikmeşe. The following three animations are of an out-of-plane trajectory, a planar trajectory, and an imitation of the [Starship Flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CZTLogln34).
